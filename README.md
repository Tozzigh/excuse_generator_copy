# Excuse Generator

> By Keili Rosales

## Objective

First Javascript exercise. ðŸ™Œ

Starting from the data provided by the teacher, the main idea of this exercise is to create JavaScript functions, which must comply with a series of rules for their realization: 
- Use exclusively imperative functional programming.
- The use of objects is prohibited.
- Documented.
- Separated into functions.
- Writing camelCase.
- Variables and names in English. 

#### Functions approach.

##### Array data
```JavaScript
let surnames = ['10', 'juan', '@12', null, 'antonioPerezDelCarmen', 'abcdefghtioiasoisdjads', 'Manolo', 'Perez', 'Soledad'];
let excuses = ['OMG?', 'Whatâ€™s going on?', 'How much is it?', '18', null, undefined, function () { }];
let names2 = ['Jeferson', 'Matilda', 'R@fael', '1van', 'Pep3', 'Loquesea', 'Fel1berto', 'Pepit@', 'D@M', 'Pep3'];
```
- The function **generateRandom** generates a random excuse with the three given arrays.
- The function **letterCounter** counts the number of letter repetitions in each array.
- The **deleteReplay** function deletes the repetitions in an array and returns the array without the repetition.
- The **reverseData** function inverts all values in the array.

## Application

1. Run the project using: `node index.js`.
2. And check the applied functions.

## Technologies

- Javascript
